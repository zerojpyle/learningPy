# learningPy
#
# This repository contains my progress going through the book:
#   <Learning Python the Hard Way> by Zed Shaw.
#
# In general, each python file represents an exercise from the book, with
# the primary exercises being named "ex#.py". In some cases, additional tasks
# are labeled similarly, but with additional description to differentiate
# them.
#
# Part of this exercise includes learning GitHub, so I'm learning as I go!
